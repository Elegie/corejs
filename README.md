# corejs

This is a repository of javascript code, which I have created and used over the years. Some chunks have been collected from external resources, proper attribution then being given in the comments.

The style is ancient, and there is neither example nor test (for now). My goal is simply to keep the scripts at hand, should the need for them arise. Use at your own risk.
